    "Ans) Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well \"labelled\" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output.

    "Ans) The biggest difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning is: Supervised machine learning algorithms are trained on datasets that include labels added by a machine learning engineer or data scientist that guide the algorithm to understand which features are important to the problem at hand. This is a very costly process, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.Unsupervised machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, are trained on unlabeled data and must determine feature importance on their own based on inherent patterns in the data, The most basic disadvantage of any Unsupervised Learning is that itâ€™s application spectrum is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter these disadvantages, the concept of Semi-Supervised Learning was introduced. In this type of learning, the algorithm is trained upon a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. Typically, this combination will contain a very small amount of labeled data and a very large amount of unlabeled data. This is useful for a few reasons. First, the process of labeling massive amounts of data for supervised learning is often prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. Whatâ€™s more, too much labeling can impose human biases on the model. That means including lots of unlabeled data during the training process actually tends to improve the accuracy of the final model while reducing the time and cost spent building it."

    "Ans) Anomaly detection is a process of finding those rare items, data points, events, or observations that make suspicions by being different from the rest data points or observations. Anomaly detection is also known as outlier detection.\n",

    "Generally, anomalous data is related to some kind of problems such as bank fraud, medical problems, malfunctioning equipment, etc.\n",

    "Unsupervised Anomaly detection does not require labeled training data. These techniques are based on two assumptions, which are:-\n",

    "a) Most of the network connections are from normal traffic, and only a small amount of data is abnormal.\n",
    "b) Malicious traffic is statistically different from normal traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis of these assumptions, data clusters of similar data points that occur frequently are assumed to be normal traffic, and those data groups that are infrequent are considered abnormal or malicious.\n",

SOM, or Self-organizing map, is a popular technique that aims to reduce the dimension of data visualization.\n",
